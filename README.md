# Fit-Ally

Fit-Ally is a fitness application built with React, Redux, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. The purpose of the app is to provide a visual representation of a user's fitness stats and activities. The app handles user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and allows users to sign up for an account and login to an existing account. Validation is done on both the client side and server side. If you do not wish to create an account, you can see how the app works by selecting the 'Demo' link. This will generate a demo user and allow you to play with the functionality without having to create an account.

You can view the live application here: https://fit-ally.herokuapp.com/
