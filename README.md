# Fit-Ally

Fit-Ally is a full-stack fitness application built with React, Redux, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. The purpose of the application is to provide a visual representation of a user's fitness statistics and activities. The application handles user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and allows users to sign up for an account and login to an existing account. Validation is done on both the client side and server side. Custom styling was done with SCSS without the use of CSS frameworks, and the charts were created with Chart.js. 

If you would like to preview the application but do not want to create an account, you can select the 'Demo' link from the landing page. This will generate a demo user named "Steven" with some pre-populated information, which will allow you to experiment with the functionality without having to create an account.
